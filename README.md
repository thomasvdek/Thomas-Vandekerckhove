# Hi there 👋 

My name is Thomas Vandekerckhove, and I'm a passionate 🥇, creative 🎨, and perceptive 🔭 Data analyst 🔧 with a hands-on approach to problem-solving and an unending thirst for knowledge 📚. Anything and everything that can be classified as technology 💻 fascinates me.

Currently, I'm based in the beautiful city of Paris where I'm looking for a new challenge as Data Analyst or Business Analyst 📊. I'm doing stuffs as Teacher Assistant for Le Wagon to help new promotions learning strong skills in Data Analytics.

Previously, I was a Growth Marketing Manager 🧑‍🔬 at OrthographIQ, focusing on challenges in Sales 💰 and Marketing 📣 to help the company to reach people willing to learn French writing at a business level. Before that, I used to be a professional Hearthstone Player 🖱️, I managed to reach a world-class level thanks to data-driven decision-making in-practice and in-game and fast learning in order to keep an edge on the other competitors. 

Oh, and I proudly hold an MS in Big Data Marketing 📈 from Toulouse Business School 🎓.
